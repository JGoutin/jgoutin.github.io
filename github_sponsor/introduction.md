# Hi there! 👋

I'm **Jérémy Goutin**, a freelance **Solutions Architect** specializing in Python, AWS cloud, and DevOps.

## What I'm Building

I'm currently focused on **[stdapi.ai](https://stdapi.ai)** — an open-source API that brings OpenAI SDK compatibility to AWS AI services and 40+ Amazon Bedrock models. This project bridges the gap between OpenAI's developer experience and AWS's powerful AI infrastructure, enabling enterprises to leverage AWS while using familiar OpenAI SDKs.

## My Open Source Work

Beyond stdapi.ai, I actively maintain and contribute to various open-source projects:

- **Python libraries** for cloud storage and build tooling
- **Ansible roles** for self-hosting secure infrastructure ([ansible_home](https://github.com/JGoutin/ansible_home))
- Tools and utilities that help developers work more efficiently with cloud platforms

## Why Sponsor?

Your sponsorship helps me:

- Dedicate more time to open-source development and maintenance
- Build tools that benefit the broader developer community
- Continue providing free, enterprise-grade solutions
- Create comprehensive documentation and examples

Most of my work focuses on making complex cloud and AI technologies more accessible to developers, with an emphasis on security, automation, and best practices.
