<img src="../assets/stdapi_ai_logo.svg" alt="stdapi.ai" width="200">

**Deploy any OpenAI-compatible application on AWS Bedrock—no code changes required.**

stdapi.ai is a production-ready OpenAI API gateway that gives you instant access to 80+ leading AI models from Claude, Nova, Llama, DeepSeek, and more through AWS Bedrock. Built for enterprises that need data sovereignty, compliance controls, and AWS direct pricing without monthly subscriptions.

#### Why stdapi.ai?

**🔒 Enterprise Compliance & Data Sovereignty**
All AI inference stays in your AWS account—data never shared with model providers or used for training. Configure allowed AWS regions to meet GDPR, HIPAA, or FedRAMP compliance requirements.

**💰 AWS Direct Pricing, No Markup**
Pay-per-use pricing with no subscriptions or monthly minimums. Pay only AWS Bedrock rates for exactly what you use—no capacity commitments required.

**🚀 Drop-in OpenAI Replacement**
Full support for chat, embeddings, images, audio (speech/transcription/translation). Works with LangChain, Continue.dev, Open WebUI, n8n, and 1000+ OpenAI-compatible tools—just change the `base_url`.

**🧠 Access to 80+ Leading Models**
Claude 4.6+ (reasoning), Nova 2, Llama 4, DeepSeek v3.2, Stable Diffusion, Mistral, Gemini, and more. Switch models instantly without code changes—no vendor lock-in.

**⚙️ Advanced AWS Bedrock Features**
Prompt caching, reasoning modes, guardrails, prompt routers, application inference profiles, automatic region optimization, and S3 integration built-in.

**🔐 Built-in Observability & Security**
OpenTelemetry integration, detailed request logging, API keys in AWS Systems Manager. CORS, proxy headers, SSRF protection, and hardened container images.
