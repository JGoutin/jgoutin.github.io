## Who am I

Hi, ðŸ‘‹

I am **JÃ©rÃ©my Goutin**, a freelance software developer from France. ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

I'm currently working as a consultant while also being an open-source contributor.

As a consultant, I am available to help with your projects with my expertise.

As an open source contributor, I am working on both personal and third-party projects.
For more information, take a look at my GitHub profile.

My native language is French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·,
but I also speak English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ (almost fluently when writing, but intermediate when 
speaking).
I also know the very basics of German ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª.

## Expertise

*TL;DR: I am mainly a 
<img src="assets/python.svg" width="16"> Python software developer, 
an <img src="assets/amazonaws.svg" width="16"> AWS cloud architect, 
and a DevOps.*

Here is a more detailed description of my expertise:

### Software development

<img src="assets/python.svg" width="16"> Python has been my main 
language since the start, and I have expertise in it.

I was the software architect or lead developer of various projects and have 
software design and architecture skills. 

My aim is to build maintainable and high-quality software.

I built web backends and API designs using 
<img src="assets/fastapi.svg" width="16"> FastAPI and SQLAlchemy (with 
<img src="assets/postgresql.svg" width="16"> PostgreSQL).

Furthermore, I occasionally worked on desktop applications with 
<img src="assets/qt.svg" width="16"> Qt.

### Cloud infrastructure

I built the cloud architecture for projects using 
<img src="assets/amazonaws.svg" width="16"> AWS.

I have a particular experience with securing AWS (least privileged IAM policies, 
VPC firewall, etc.) and successfully passed an external security audit.

I built both for serverless applications (using
<img src="assets/amazonlambda.svg" width="16"> Lambda, DynamoDB, 
Cloudfront, etc.) and more classical applications (using
<img src="assets/amazonec2.svg" width="16"> EC2, VPC, Aurora/RDS, 
etc.)

My experience also includes various other AWS services like S3, SQS, SNS, SES, Route53, 
Cognito, ECS, and more.

As much as possible, I manage the cloud using infrastructure as code with
<img src="assets/terraform.svg" width="16"> Terraform.

Furthermore, I also have some experience with 
<img src="assets/microsoftazure.svg" width="16"> Microsoft Azure 
(Including Microsoft 365 administration), 
<img src="assets/openstack.svg" width="16"> OpenStack, and 
<img src="assets/alibabacloud.svg" width="16"> Alibaba Cloud.

### DevOps

I have solid experience with CI/CD pipelines, and I am able to fully automate them from 
testing to deployment in cloud environments with 
<img src="assets/githubactions.svg" width="16"> GitHub Actions and 
<img src="assets/azurepipelines.svg" width="16"> Azure Pipeline.

### System administration

<img src="assets/fedora.svg" width="16"> Fedora has been my main OS 
for years. I also commonly use 
<img src="assets/centos.svg" width="16"> CentOS,
<img src="assets/ubuntu.svg" width="16"> Ubuntu,
<img src="assets/debian.svg" width="16"> Debian, and
<img src="assets/alpinelinux.svg" width="16"> Alpine Linux
(in containers).

I have experience building Linux server configurations with 
<img src="assets/ansible.svg" width="16"> Ansible and
<img src="assets/docker.svg" width="16"> Docker.

Likewise, I have some experience and a particular interest in Linux "hardening" and 
security.

Furthermore, I also use 
<img src="assets/pfsense.svg" width="16"> Pfsense and
<img src="assets/truenas.svg" width="16"> TrueNAS.

I also have experience in 
<img src="assets/windows.svg" width="16"> Microsoft Windows 
(almost all versions, but not as a server).

### Data analytic

My initial formation was scientific, and I switched to software development by building
data analytic tools for optical engineers and for automating test benches.

I have experience with 
<img src="assets/numpy.svg" width="16"> Numpy,
<img src="assets/scipy.svg" width="16"> Scipy,
<img src="assets/pandas.svg" width="16"> Pandas, Matplotlib, Cython, 
and the Python scientific stack in general.
