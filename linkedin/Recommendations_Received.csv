Jean-Michel,Frouin,Corcentric,Software Development Manager,Jérémy is a highly-skilled person in Python development and amazon AWS. Jérémy set up an AWS/MicroService architecture for us which (correctly) used all the most appropriate techniques and components from Amazon. It was a real pleasure to work with him and I knew that when he took on a subject he was always able to bring it to fruition and above all with the necessary quality. He worked on the new v2 version of our platform based on FastApi and a lot of advanced python stuff. It was/is a pleasure to work with him.,"09/07/23, 01:58 PM",VISIBLE
